# GUI-BMI-Calc
A GUI BMI calculator

# To Run
To run the program, make sure that you first have python 3.x installed on your computer, you can find out how to do this at https://www.python.org/
Next, just double click the program to run it.
A GUI should pop up. Simply, select the measurement system that you desire. Then enter in the info for height and weight and hit "Submit".

# Future Updates
I plan on making some future updates including a scale to tell you where you are (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, etc.).
The last thing that I would like to add, is compiling the source code into an executable to make it easier for the everyday Joe to use.
